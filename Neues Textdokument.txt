Do you know it? You have been back to the Trader and don't remember where to put your rubles?? Now there is a possibility to bring your rubles among the people.
DayZCasino Mod currently has three games. A dice game, blackjack and lucky wheel. Go to the place where your admin placed the games, default is in and press the "P" key. Then the respective game opens and off you go.

Dice game:
Bet on a number from 1 to 6. Press the "dice" button and off you go. Here you can win five times your bet.

Black Jack:
Collect as many cards as you can until you have 21 points. Then let the bank draw its cards. Whoever stays below 22 and is closer to 21 wins.
If you have a 21 from the beginning, you win three times your bet.
If you hit the bank, you get back double your bet.
If the bank has as many points as you do, it's a tie and everyone gets their bet back.
If the bank wins, you lose your bet.

Wheel of Fortune:
For each spin you bet a fixed amount defined by the admin. You now have the chance to win the jackpot or up to five times your bet.
Of course there are also Niten where you lose everything.
If you lose, half of your bet goes into the jackpot.

7. Add "@DayZCasino" after "@CF" to your server start script
8. start server first time.
9. wait for boot finished
10. stop server
11. go to configured server profile folder, there are now to new json files "dayZCasinoConfig.json" and "dayZCasinoJackpot.json"

To dayZCasinoConfig.json:

You can switch the models of the game object. I recommend using the Nehr (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1681963184&searchtext=Nehr) Mod and the "Nehr_Gaming_01" object.
To switch the object replace "Land_FuelStation_Feed" with the object of your choice.
The current positions of the games are in Kumyrna in the church.

In this file is needed, when the server crashed or shout down. It stores the actual value of jackpot.
